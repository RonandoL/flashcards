      <div class="jsdef item">
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[7] Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>

  <!-- MODULO -->

    <div class="moddef item">
      <p>mod·u·lo
        (in number theory) with respect to or using a modulus of a specified number. Two numbers are congruent modulo a given number if they give the same remainder when divided by that number.

  <!-- OPERATOR -->
    <h1 class="show-opdef link">Operators</h1>
    <div class="opdef item">
      <p>The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.

  <!-- Variable naming conventions -->
    <h1 class="show-variablenamingdef link">Variable naming conventions</h1>
    <div class="variablenamingdef item">
      <p>In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

      <p>Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>to reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;[1]
        to enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.</li>
        <li>to enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.</li>
        <li>to enhance source code appearance (for example, by disallowing overlong names or unclear abbreviations).</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
        The choice of naming conventions can be an enormously controversial issue, with partisans of each holding theirs to be the best and others to be inferior. Colloquially, this is said to be a matter of dogma.[2] Many companies have also established their own set of conventions to best meet their interests.
